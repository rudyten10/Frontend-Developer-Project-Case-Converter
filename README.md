# Frontend-Developer-Project-Case-Converter

Description
You need to write a long piece of text. Suddenly, it turned out that it has to be in the upper case. Do you really need to rewrite the entire text? Of course not. Let's create a tool that automatically changes the case. Let's start with implementing the first HTML elements.

Objectives
In this stage, your web page should contain the following HTML elements:

A div block with the title class. Make sure it contains the Case Converter text;
A textarea element. It should be empty by default;
A button element with the upper-case id;
A button element with the lower-case id;
A button element with the proper-case id;
A button element with the sentence-caseid.
We will implement the functionality behind the buttons in the next stages.
